============== Snowflake Questionaree =======================
1. What is snow pipe ?
Snowpipe enables loading data from files as soon as they’re available in a stage. This means you can load data from files in micro-batches, 
making it available to users within minutes, rather than manually executing COPY statements on a schedule to load larger batches.

2. What is virtual warehouse and it's use in snowflake ?
A virtual warehouse, often referred to simply as a “warehouse”, is a cluster of compute resources in Snowflake. A warehouse provides the required resources,
such as CPU, memory, and temporary storage, to perform the following operations in a Snowflake session:
Executing SQL SELECT statements that require compute resources (e.g. retrieving rows from tables and views).
Performing DML operations, such as:
Updating rows in tables (DELETE , INSERT , UPDATE).
Loading data into tables (COPY INTO <table>).
Unloading data from tables (COPY INTO <location>).
