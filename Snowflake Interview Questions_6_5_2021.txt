Snowflake Interview Questions .v1

 EMPENOFORE:

	1. How do you manage the security in Snowflake. What encryption do you use to secure your Snowflake account? Any third-party encryption tool or Snowflake in-built?
	
	2. you have a User: KUMV0012 - user name,
	The same user is assigned two different Role:
			1. HR_ROLE - having access only to schema having HR related data
			2. MKT_ROLE - having access only to schema having MARKETING related data
	Condition: Both the roles assigned to same user but you are not allowed to grant privilege to each-other role.
	Now, this one USER wants to access the data of both HR and MARKETING schema at the same time in a same query.
	e.g. you logged in with HR role and running the below query will throws error:
		SELECT ID, NAME FROM DB1.SCHEMA_HR.TBL1
		JOIN DB2.SCHEMA_MKT.TBL2
		ON COL1 = COL2
	How will you see the data of both tables with one single role.
	
	3. How will you clone a database from PROD to DEV environmnet, without getting the privileges of database level but getting all the child db objects and their privileges.
	
	4. what data model you use in your datawarehouse?e.g. Kimball, Inmon, data vault.

	5. what fact tables your project?
	
	5. what are SNOWFLAKE features you think are out of the box?
	
	6. do you use zero-copy cloning, Time-travel and Fail-safe? Can you configure Fail-Safe Period?
	
	7. As an Admin you created a Custom-role in the hierarchy, same to level of SYSADMIN. Will SYSTEM be able to access everything what that custom role will have?

	
	
EMERSON:
	
	1. What transformation you used in IICS in your data.
	2. What is lookup in IICS? How do you run an SQL in IICS?
	
	3. what is search Optimization in Snowflake?
	
	4. what are materialized views and how to implement them? what is their purpose?
	
	5. If you doing an aggregation and group by on a column which has NULL Value, how does snowflake handles that?
	
	6. Does snowflake stores data in Temp file internally in aggregated form?
	
	7. what is clustering and how will you decide a clustering column.
	
	8. what are caches and how do you use cache in Snowflake?
	
	9. what is Group by and Group Roll up in snowflake?
	
	10. Two	different users with two different roles, trying to retrieve data from same table and same query. Will they make use of Result Cache?
	
	11. what Agile methodology you use in your project?
	
	12. what are the various ways of scheduling the tasks? how to schedule task at a specific time and how to use cron?
	
	13. what are streams? do they capture delete as well?
	
	
HCL:

	1. what all steps you follow to migrate an on-prem to on cloud datawarehouse
	
	2. difference between MPP and distributed processing
	
	3. you have three different sources sql server, excel, json , what you will you perform to load all the sources to a cloud storage?
	
	4. what are dimensions, junk and conformed dimensions, what are facts?
	
	5. how to design an ETL job to do data migration?
	
	6. what are data pipelines you worked upon?

Best Practices in SF :
VW management:
	Scale up -- query performance increase, parallel execution enable if loading multiple files to a single tables
	scale out -- handle concurrent users and query 
	
	Start with right -sizing --
	Linear Scaling -- query per tuning -- bcz they are cost neutral
	Auto resume and suspend -- cost saving
	
Cost Management:
	Compute	cost -- VWH
	Storage cost -- Table(perm, transient, temp -- tt, fs), Matr views, stages--internal
	Services cost -- PIpe
	data transfer cost - cross region
	
	Saving: Resource Monitors -  accountlevel, warehouse level
			TT -- Enterprise -- TT-0-90, as per requi configure TT period, instead of tt, use copy cloning for backup of data
			utilize temp tables for session specific storage,|| use trasient tables, for  staging where you do a trunacte and load
			
Security : layered:
				Network -- ip allowed list
				Account -- SSO, MFA, 
				Object -- Use roles and privileges
				Data -- Encryption, periodic rekeying
					MFA -- DUO security -- reco for ACCOUNTADMIN roles
					Federated Auth + SSO -- SSO + OKTA verfication
					Role management - system defined roles

So we use Snowflake for ELT purpose and Informatica cloud for ETL in different requirements.
There are various challanges we faced like query optimizations, security related concerns, cost optimizations as well.


security related concerns - Dynamic data masking
 for Continuous data loads - we in some requirements we have Snowpipe, in some cases we have used stored procedures with Streams
